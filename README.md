# 🚀 Grey-box Participant Access Management System

## 📌 Overview
This system helps administrators **manage and track platform/tool access** for different contributor types in a centralized way using Notion.

## 🎯 Goals
- Ensure **new Grey-box members** get access to the correct tools quickly.
- Centralize access tracking to **avoid manual updates** across multiple platforms.
- Enable **easy role-based access control** using Notion.

## 🏗️ System Components
### **1️⃣ Contributors Database (Notion Table)**
**Tracks all participants and their assigned tools.**
- **Name** → Participant's full name
- **Role** → Dropdown (Common, Developer, UI/UX, etc.)
- **Assigned Platforms** → Linked to the Platforms Database
- **Email** → User's email for invites
- **Access Status** → ✅ Granted / ❌ Pending

### **2️⃣ Platforms Database (Notion Table)**
**Tracks all tools and their corresponding roles.**
- **Platform Name** → Google Workspace, GitHub, Figma, etc.
- **Assigned Roles** → Multi-select (Common, Developer, UI/UX, etc.)
- **Access Link** → URL to invite page or admin panel
- **Admin Contact** → Responsible person for granting access

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
### **1️⃣ Create Notion Databases**
1. **Create a Contributors Database** with the columns listed above.
2. **Create a Platforms Database** with linked relations to the Contributors Database.
3. **Link both databases** so that a contributor's assigned tools are easily visible.

### **2️⃣ Automate Access Granting (Optional)**
#### 🔹 **Zapier Integration (Recommended)**
- **Trigger:** When a new contributor is added to Notion.
- **Action:** Send an email/slack notification to the admin for tool access setup.

#### 🔹 **Google Forms + Notion Integration**
- Collect new participant details via **Google Forms** → Auto-add them to Notion.
- Admin reviews and assigns tool access.

#### 🔹 **Custom Script (Advanced)**
- If API access is available, a script can **automate user invitations** to platforms.

## 🛠️ Access Management Process
### ✅ **New Contributor Onboarding**
1. Add new member to **Contributors Database**.
2. Assign the correct **role** and **tools**.
3. Admin grants platform access and updates **Access Status**.

### 🛑 **Offboarding Process**
1. Remove the participant from all assigned platforms.
2. Update **Access Status** to ❌ Revoked.
3. Archive the contributor's record if needed.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Automate **role-based invites** via APIs.
- Build an **access request form** integrated with Notion.
- Regular access **review & cleanup process** for inactive members.
